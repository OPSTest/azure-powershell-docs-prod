# Get-ServiceFabricNodeTransitionProgress

## SYNOPSIS
Gets the progress of a node transition operation started using Get-ServiceFabricNodeTransitionProgress.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-ServiceFabricNodeTransitionProgress -OperationId <Guid> [-TimeoutSec <Int32>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Gets the progress of a node transition operation started using **Get-ServiceFabricNodeTransitionProgress**.
This cmdlet returns an object of type **System.Fabric.NodeTransitionProgress**.  The State property indicates the current state of the operation.  For example, Running means it is in progress, and Completed means it finished successfully.  See the example below for usage.
## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
PS C:\> $currentProgress = Get-ServiceFabricNodeTransitionProgress -OperationId c645433e-a68f-4c8a-8cfb-076d339726a8
```

This example gets the progress of operation c645433e-a68f-4c8a-8cfb-076d339726a8, which was started using Start-ServiceFabricNodeTransition.  You can see the current state by inspecting the State object.  In this example, it's Running:

```
PS C:\> $currentProgress.State

  State Result
  ----- ------
Running
```

If the operation fails, the State property will have a value of Faulted.  More information about why it failed will be in the Result.Exception.ErrorCode object.  Note that the Result object is null until the operation has reached a terminal state.  The example below shows this object after the operation has failed.  The issue in this case is that an incorrect NodeInstanceId was provided when initiating the operation through Start-ServiceFabricNodeTransition.

```
PS C:\> $currentProgress.Result.Exception.ErrorCode
InstanceIdMismatch
```

## PARAMETERS

### -OperationId
A Guid used to track the operation.  The value of the parameter should be the same value that was passed into **Start-ServiceFabricNodeTransition**, which started the operation.
