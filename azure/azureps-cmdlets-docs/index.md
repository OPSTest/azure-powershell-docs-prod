# Get started with Azure PowerShell cmdlets

Azure PowerShell cmdlets provide support for the following Azure services:

[Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/resourcemanager/)

Azure Resource Manager enables you to work with the resources in your solution as a group.
You can deploy, update, or delete all the resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation.


[Azure Service Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/servicemanagement/)

Azure Service Management helps you manage your deployments, hosted services, and storage accounts.


[Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/storage/)

Azure Storage is the cloud storage solution for modern applications that rely on durability, availability, and scalability to meet your needs.
Storage supports Blob storage, File storage, Queue storage, and Table storage.


## Install and configure

To use the cmdlets, you need to install and configure Azure PowerShell to connect it to your account. For more information, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/powershell-install-configure/).
